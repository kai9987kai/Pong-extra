## Play it

### Option A — Just open the file
1. Download / clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Option B — Run a local server (recommended)
Some browsers apply stricter rules when opening files directly. A tiny local server avoids that.

**Python (Windows/macOS/Linux):**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
